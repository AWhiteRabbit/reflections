What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

initializing creates a git repository. any files in that directory will be saved to git. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is that place you put your files you may be adding to your git repository. I think it gives more flexibility in what you commit or decide not to commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

once they are in the staging area before you commit just go through and see if the changes feel logical. if they don't feel logical remove or add then commit. it's the in between stage.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

working on adding a new feature and unsure of the outcome. branching would help so i don't use the master. or if i wanted to change the language and i need to make a new branch. branch help by keeping everything organized,labeled(the branch) and seperate from other branches.
