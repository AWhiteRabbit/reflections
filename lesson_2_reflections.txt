What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

initializing creates a git repository. any files in that directory will be saved to git. 

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is that place you put your files you may be adding to your git repository. I think it gives more flexibility in what you commit or decide not to commit.
